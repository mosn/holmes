# Holmes contributor guide

Holmes is released under the Apache 2.0 license, and follows a very standard Github development process, using Github tracker for issues and merging pull requests into master. If you would like to contribute something,  or simply want to hack on the code this document should help you get started.

Before we accept a non-trivial patch or pull request we will need you to sign the Contributor License Agreement. Signing the contributor’s agreement does not grant anyone commits rights to the main repository, but it does mean that we can accept your contributions, and you will get an author credit if we do. Active contributors might be asked to join the core team and given the ability to merge pull requests.

## Code Conventions

None of these is essential for a pull request, but they will all help.

1. Code format
- With cli, run `goimports -w yourfile.go` and `golint yourfile.go` to format the style
- With ide like goland, select 'Group stdlib imports', 'Move all stdlib imports in a single group', 'Move all imports in a single declaration' in Go->imports page
- We would check code format when run ci test, so please ensure that you have built project before you push branch.
2. Make sure all new `.go` files to have a simple doc class comment
   with at least an `author` tag identifying you, and preferably at least a
   paragraph on what the class is for.
3. Add the ASF license header comment to all new `.go` files (copy from existing files in the project)
4. Add yourself as an `author` to the `.go` files that you modify substantially (more than cosmetic changes).
5. Add some docs.
6. A few unit tests would help a lot as well — someone has to do it.
7. When writing a commit message please follow [these conventions](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html), if you are fixing an existing issue please add Fixes gh-XXXX at the end of the commit message (where XXXX is the issue number).
8. Please ensure that code coverage will not decrease.
9. Contribute a PR as the rule of Gitflow Workflow, and you should follow the pull request's rules.

## Version naming convention

Holmes's version contains three-digit with the format x.x.x, the first one is for compatibility; the second one is for new features and enhancement; the last one is for a bug fix.

## PR review policy for maintainers

The following strategies are recommended for project maintainers to review code:

1. Check the issue with this PR
2. Check the solution's reasonability
3. Check UT's and Benchmark's result
4. Pay attention to the code which makes the code structure change, the usage of the global variable, the handling of the corner case and concurrency
